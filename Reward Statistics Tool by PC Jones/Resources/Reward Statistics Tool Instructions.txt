1.) Put all your accounts in the reward_statistics_accounts.txt file, one per line.
You can just copy and paste the username:postingkey:etc format from other files, everything after the first : is ignored

Example:
account1
account2
account3

Or:
account1:postingkey:activekey
account2:postingkey
account2:postingkey:activekey

2.) Run the Reward Statistics Tool and enter either a date to get the rewards for a specific date or enter e.g. 10 for the data of the last 10 days. 
Note that splinterlands only allows to access data for roughly the last ~ 25-30 days

3.) If the generated CSV does look wrongly formatted open the csv_seperator.txt file and change the semicolon(;) to a comma(,)
