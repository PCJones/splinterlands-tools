Welcome to the Asset Transfer Bot by PC Jones!

PLEASE FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY IN ORDER TO USE THIS BOT CORRECTLY.


1) Install dotnet 6.0 runtime for console apps (on windows):
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime

2) In the config folder you will find a file called asset_transfer_accounts.txt. 
Open the asset_transfer_accounts.txt file. 
Here you will list all of your alt accounts from which you are transferring. 
You need the username and posting key to log into each account. 
Please note that the usernames are case sensitive and should be written in lowercase letters and without @.
Use the following format:

username:posting_key:active_key

3) YOU MUST ENTER ONLY ONE ACCOUNT PER LINE.

4) Once you have entered the information for all of your alt accounts, run the Splinterlands Asset Transfer Bot.exe file. 
The program will prompt you to enter your main account infomation to where you will be transferring all of your assets. 

5) THIS STEP IS EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT. YOU MUST ENTER YOUR MAIN ACCOUNT NAME CORRECTLY. 
CONFIRM YOUR MAIN ACCOUNT NAME ON YOUR MAIN ACCOUNT SPLINTERLANDS HOME PAGE. IT IS LOCATED BELOW THE DAILY QUEST BOX. 
THE ACCOUNT NAME THAT YOU ENTER IS CASE SENSITIVE. THE PROGRAM WILL ASK YOU TWICE TO CONFIRM YOUR MAIN ACCOUNT NAME. 
ENTER ONLY YOUR ACCOUNT NAME; DO NOT INCLUDE THE @ BEFORE IT. 

FAILURE TO ENTER YOUR MAIN ACCOUNT NAME EXACTLY AS IT SHOULD BE WILL EITHER CAUSE THE PROGRAM TO WORK INCORRECTLY 
OR YOUR ASSETS WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO SOMEONE ELSE'S ACCOUNT. 
YOU MUST BE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR OWN ASSETS AND MAKE 100% SURE THAT YOU ARE TRANSFERRING YOUR ALT ACCOUNT ASSETS TO YOUR MAIN ACCOUNT. 
ALL TRANSACTIONS ON SPLINTERLANDS ARE IRREVERSIBLE, SO YOU MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND ENTER THE INFORMATION CORRECTLY.

6) You will be asked if you want to transfer your cards, SPS, and DEC to your main account. 
Please enter y or n in response to each query in order to indicate your preference.
Alternatively see 9)

7) Sit back, relax and enjoy knowing that you no longer have to spend hours working on all of your alt accounts!

8) Alternative Sending Mode:
You can use the format
username:posting_key:active_key:receiving_user in asset_transfer_accounts.txt file
to specify which user sends stuff to which account! Be careful to not mistype the receiving username!
You will still need to specify an account to send to on bot start in case some accounts dont have a receiving user

9) Config mode:
You can also use the asset_transfer_config.txt to specify what the bot should do
